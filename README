Description
---------------------
The SAGES Mobile platform is part of the Suite for Automated
Global Electronic bioSurveillance (SAGES).  SAGES provides a modular, flexible,
open-source set of tools to aid in the creation of electronic disease 
surveillance capabilities.  SAGES Mobile provides a colleciton of Android based
applications that work in unison with a Java based ETL for mobile data collection
into the SAGES suite. One of the key characteristics of the tools is the ability
to collect data using SMS (text messages).

Components
---------------------
The SAGES Mobile platform leverages a number of other existing open
source projects from other sources (project dependencies are documented in a
separate file).

The SAGES Mobile platform includes three modules:
  - a form rendering Android mobile client for form based data entry
    and data submission over SMS and data connections
  - an Android mobile receiver for parsing SMS data from a mobile client
  - a Java based ETL application which extracts data from the mobile
    receiver and loads the informtation into a relational database

Use and Deployment
---------------------
The SAGES Mobile platform is intended for use in the collection and submission 
of bio-surveillance or health-related data.

Deployment of the system requires:
  - Android devices(2.3 and higher) for mobile clients
  - Android devices (2.3) for the mobile receiver
  - A Windows platform host computer for running the ETL
